This simulation modeled customers shopping and checking out at a grocery store using SimPy. Each shopper was assigned a random number of items, spent time shopping, and then joined a checkout queue. Checkers processed customers at a fixed rate, with idle time tracked when no shoppers were waiting.

- **Staffing balance matters**: Too few checkers caused long queues and high wait times, while too many checkers led to wasted idle time.
- **Customer flow impacts efficiency**: Faster arrival rates increased pressure on the checkout system, highlighting the importance of matching staff to demand.
- **Shopping behavior is predictable**: Average shopping times were consistent since they depended only on items purchased, but wait times varied widely depending on queue length.
- **Metrics provide insight**: Tracking average wait time, maximum wait time, idle time, and average items purchased helped reveal bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

The simulation demonstrated how queueing dynamics affect customer experience and staff utilization. It reinforced the importance of balancing resources with demand to minimize wait times while avoiding excessive idle time.
